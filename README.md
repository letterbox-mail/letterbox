## Coding Style

Please try to adhere to the [Github Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide).

(If you want it super specific, there is also the very deep [Ray Wenderlich Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide))

You can use the [Swimat Plugin](https://github.com/Jintin/Swimat) to do parts of that automatically.
